INSTALLATION

Ungzip and untar the archive into some directory.
Assign an environment variable EIFFEL_VERSANT to
be:

VERSANT_EIFFEL to	{your-installation-dir}/versant/v1.0


Then goto $VERSANT_EIFFEL/C/ and cd to the directory 
that contains your OS/compiler specific Makefile.

	soliss - Solaris, ISS 
	solise - Solaris, ISE
	etc..

then run make in that directory to compile the C libraries.


Then you can compile the examples in $VERSANT_EIFFEL/examples.

The Ace files assume that Versant has been installed in:

	 /usr/local/versant/${VERSANT_REL}

where ${VERSANT_REL} is the Versant release number (like 5.0.8).
